Marianne said she was worried about Peggy, who was the only one of the three of them not to get the scholarship. She said it would be hard on her. Connell inhaled and said nothing. Peggy didn’t need subsidised tuition or free on-campus accommodation, because she lived at home in Blackrock and her parents were both doctors, but Marianne was intent on seeing the scholarships as a matter of personal feeling rather than economic fact.  

[...]

- Though in terms of financial circumstances too, obviously, she said. I mean, it’s kind of ridiculous they don’t means-test these things.  

- I guess we’re from very different backgrounds, class-wise.

# Question {background-color="#498b9dff" style="color: #fff;"}

Is the experience of mobility associated with attitudes towards principles of social justice?

# Previous studies {background-color="#498b9dff" style="color: #fff;"}



## Social justice principles

Scales created by Hülle et al. [-@hulle_measuring_2018] based on the following principles:
<br>

- **Equality**: Everyone should receive the same in a society  

- **Equity**: Benefits and burdens should be distributed according to individual investments

- **Need**: Everyone should receive enough to cover basic needs

- **Entitlement**: Benefits or burdens should be allocated according to achieved status such as gender, education, occupation, or origin 


## Associated factors

- **Education**: Social class and education attainment as associated factors for welfare attitudes and views on inequality [@steele_attitudes_2019; @reyes_are_2022; @adriaans_basic_2022; @oorschot_recent_2022]

- **Mobility**: Integenerational educational mobility related with attitudes to immigration [@creighton_educational_2022] and openness to globalisation [@kunst_as_2023]


# Methods and data {background-color="#498b9dff" style="color: #fff;"}

## Data source

::::{.columns} 

:::{.column width="30%"}
![](./img/ess_topline.png)
:::

:::{.column width="70%"}
- European Social Survey

- Irish Research Council  

- Special module on Fairness and Justice (2018)

- 29 European countries    

- `r format(nrow(ess_cci), big.mark = ",")` observations

:::

## Variables

- **Outcome**: Equality, Equity, Need, Justice  

- **Covariates**: Age, Gender, Feeling about household income, Parental educational 
attainment (Origin), Respondent's educational attainment (Destination)

- **Explanatory**: Mobility between Origin and Destination

## More questions

- Are there any country-level characteristics that could explain the differences
found in mobility effects?  


- Theoretical or methodological explanations for differences across principles?
(clear for equality but no observed differences for the other three)
